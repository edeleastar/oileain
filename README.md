# Oileain

The application is built using SvelteKit & Leaflet. It is running here:

- <https://oileain.netlify.app>

It is an experiment in rendering maps of the Islands of Ireland on a Svelte single page application using Leaflet.js maps. The island details are derived from the book [Oileain](http://www.oileain.org/) by David Walsh. It relies the API hosted in [this repository](https://github.com/edeleastar/oileain-api), which is an immutable json version of David's book.

The application is a [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction) app with a UX designed using [Skeleton](https://www.skeleton.dev/). The source [public on GithHb](https://github.com/edeleastar/oileain-refresh).

Oileain (Irish for "islands") is a web application that allows users to:

- View a comprehensive map of Irish islands
- Explore islands by coastal region
- Navigate to detailed information about specific islands
- View satellite, terrain, and contextual maps for navigation purposes
- Access coordinates and descriptive information for points of interest

The application serves as both a reference tool and an exploration platform for those interested in Irish geography and island navigation.
